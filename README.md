# SnapCal

Is a camera calculator app, that currently supports selfish features 
(for example covering only the ND filters I own).

The existing camera calculator was doing things slightly differently 
than what is my preference and I had an urge to try Android development.

Tested on Android 9 Lenovo phone and in Pixel5 emulator.
